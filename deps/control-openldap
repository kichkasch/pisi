Package: openldap
Version: 2.3.43
Description: Open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol - a really DIRTY compilation of a package, which is just doing the job for me. This is NOT a proper LDAP package. I will only keep it as long as no 'official' LDAP package is made available in the distribution(s).
